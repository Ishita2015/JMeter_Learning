# JMeter_Learning

It is a repository for JMeter learning.

It contains one test plan as per below requirements:

1. Write a load test script for all pages, using Jmeter (you can use the same login-credentials for all threads)
2. Please use below settings:

   a. Users: 50
   
   b. Ramp Up time: 60 seconds
   
   c. Test Duration: 300 seconds
   
   d. Validate by status code
   
3. All requests and connections for all pages should be simulated by the load test. The test should exactly reproduce the behaviour of the website.
